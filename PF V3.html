            </h3>
            <p class="aboutMeText">My name is Presley Covarrubias and I am 20 years old. I was born and raised in Sheboygan Wisconsin which doesn't have many things to do, but it is a nice place to live. I am currently a junior at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay. I am majoring in information technology and data science with an emphesis in game studies. In the project section I have included a description of a game I have created with two other people during an event. For my future I am planning on creating video games for a living which is the main reason why I included one that I have worked on this year.</p>

            <p class="projectText">Student club game jam event project: Two other people and myself created a video game called Mendel Mash. The point of the game is to merge plants together in garden plots to try and create different varieties of plants. We utilized Mendels inheritance laws for when players merge plants. We applied Mendels inheritance laws to the roots, leavs, and blooms of each plant. Each of these attributes have a point value and are averaged to indicate a plants rarity.</p>
